The office_management project is a system designed to track and manage employee information in an office setting. It keeps a record of how many employees work in the office, details each employee's salary, and logs the date they joined the company. The project aims to streamline HR operations, ensuring easy access to crucial employee data, improving payroll management, and maintaining accurate employment records. Through this system, administrators can efficiently manage workforce data, monitor employee status, and generate reports on employment and salary trends within the office.
